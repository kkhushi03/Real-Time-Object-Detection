Sign Language Recognition


This prototype "understands" sign language for deaf people
Includes all code to prepare data (eg from ChaLearn dataset), extract features, train neural network, and predict signs during live demo
Based on deep learning techniques, in particular convolutional neural networks (including state-of-the-art 3D model) and recurrent neural networks (LSTM)
Built with Python, Keras+Tensorflow and OpenCV (for video capturing and manipulation)
