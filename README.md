# Sign Language Recognition

âœ… This prototype "understands" sign language for deaf people
âœ… Includes all code to prepare data (eg from ChaLearn dataset), extract features, train neural network, and predict signs during live demo
âœ… Based on deep learning techniques, in particular, convolutional neural networks (including state-of-the-art 3D model) and recurrent neural networks (LSTM)
âœ… Built with Python, Keras+Tensorflow and OpenCV (for video capturing and manipulation)

# Requirements
This code requires at least

ðŸš€ python 3.6.5
ðŸš€ tensorflow 1.8.0
ðŸš€ keras 2.2.0
ðŸš€ opencv-python 3.4.1.15
ðŸš€ A GPU is necessary for training the neural networks (e.g., aws p2.xlarge). The live demo works on an ordinary laptop (without GPU), such as a MacBook Pro, i5, or 8GB.
